# Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-07-07_

## Shipped / Working

- **v0.3.8 on PyPI** — released via Trusted Publishing (OIDC) on tag; GitHub
  Release auto-cut from CHANGELOG.
- **Two-layer memory** — `crow` (global identity) + per-project namespaces, live.
- **Never-forget model** — dormancy + spreading activation replaced time-based
  decay; nothing is auto-forgotten.
- **Hybrid retrieval** — BM25 (FTS5) + semantic ranking on `memory_recall`.
- **suggested_relations + similar_memories** — non-blocking hints on
  `memory_store` / `memory_update` (link vs merge candidates).
- **Credential vault** — OS-keychain backed; `credential_*` tools.
- **Memory Explorer UI** — React/Vite graph + dashboard under `ui/`.
- **Cross-platform** — platformdirs DB path; CI green on ubuntu/macos/windows × 3.11–3.13.

## In Progress

- **Dogfooding-feedback arc (tasks 1-6, three themed PRs).** A month of hard
  daily use surfaced six retrieval-efficiency and hygiene pain points; shipping
  them as: **PR A** (context efficiency: multi-namespace `memory_context` +
  compact mode + context loads no longer credited as accesses — branch
  `feature/context-efficiency`, this PR), **PR B** (staleness hints for
  point-in-time memories referencing open PRs/branches), **PR C** (save
  discipline via `.claude` client hooks + proactive near-dupe surfacing and a
  brain cleanup pass).
- **Networked brain (Phase 5 reframe → "The Crow's Nest") — parked behind the
  feedback arc.** Done: transport keystone (`gingugu serve`) and the promotion
  bridge **Stage 1** (`gingugu promote`, merged in PR #11). Next when resumed:
  **Stage 2** consolidation (merge near-dupes into one canonical memory with a
  `contributors[]` list), then **Stage 3** conflict detection (`contradicts`
  edges via a small local LLM judge / Ollama), then **Stage 4** wiring the
  source to the real local brain. See `docs/roadmap.md` and the architecture
  memory in the `gingugu` namespace.

## Recently Completed

- **2026-07-07** — Context efficiency (PR A of the feedback arc):
  `memory_context` accepts a comma-separated namespace list and de-dupes
  across loads (cross-namespace patterns previously repeated per namespace);
  new `compact` mode returns title + ~200-char excerpt; context loads now
  refresh the dormancy clock only instead of bumping `access_count` (closes
  the rich-get-richer ranking loop). 5 new tests, 206 total.
- **2026-07-07** — PR #11 merged: promotion bridge Stage 1 + metadata-over-HTTP
  dict coercion fix.
- **2026-06-29** — Promotion bridge **Stage 1** (`gingugu promote`,
  `src/gingugu/promote.py`): MCP client that reads a source brain, applies the
  locked exclusion-based filter (verified, minus episodic/personal tags, minus
  secret-content), stamps provenance, and stores into a central brain
  idempotently. Also fixed a real latent bug — `metadata` on
  `memory_store`/`memory_update` now accepts a dict (HTTP transports deliver
  JSON objects as dicts; the `str`-only param had made remote metadata
  unusable). 16 new tests, 201 total. Verified live across two instances.
  Branch `feature/promote-bridge`.
- **2026-06-29** — `gingugu serve` streamable-HTTP transport with Bearer-token
  auth and a `/healthz` probe; self-persisting token at `<db-dir>/serve_token`;
  `MEMORY_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED` flag to run an instance without the credential
  vault. New `serve.py` module; 9 tests (`tests/test_serve.py`), 185 total.
  Verified live (auth gating + full MCP handshake + client store/recall against
  a central instance over the wire). Branch `feature/serve-transport`.
- **2026-06-29** — Reconciled `docs/roadmap.md` with shipped reality (Phase 4 →
  Phase 5 complete / Phase 6 in flight; 112 → 176 test count; embeddings + RRF
  marked shipped).
- **2026-06-29** — Positive-path unit tests for `_suggest_relations`
  (`tests/test_suggest_relations.py`): mocked search scores pin threshold,
  self/exclude-id, already-related, and limit behavior.
- **2026-06-29** — README "Memory Explorer UI" section clarified: explicit
  Terminal 1 / Terminal 2 labels + Node.js 18+ prerequisite.
- **2026-06-29** — `handlers/memory.py` split (PR #7): read tools
  (`memory_recall`, `memory_context`) moved to new `handlers/recall.py`;
  `memory.py` keeps the write side. `memory.py` 327→203, `recall.py` 152.
  Shared helper imports repointed from `.memory` to `.helpers`.
- **2026-06-26** — Claude Code onboarding kit merged (PR #6); history scrubbed
  of work-repo references + Claude co-author lines (gingugu is public/personal).
- **2026-06-25** — Claude Code config + AI knowledge base added (this kit):
  generic `.claude/hooks/`, `settings.json`, `/creating-pr` (GitHub) +
  `/sink-the-ship` commands, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, populated `.ai/`, and
  `.gitignore` additions (`logs/`, `.claude/data/`, hook `__pycache__`).
- **2026-06-24** — v0.3.8: `suggested_relations` hint on `memory_store` /
  `memory_update`; 2 contract tests; released to PyPI.

## Next Up

- **Feedback arc PR B + PR C** (staleness hints; save-discipline hooks +
  near-dupe surfacing/cleanup) — see In Progress.
- **Promotion bridge Stage 2-4** — consolidation with `contributors[]`,
  conflict detection, wiring to the real local brain (Stage 1 shipped, PR #11).
- Repo-ingestion agent to cold-seed central with org breadth.
- Data-ownership decision before hosting work-repo knowledge (personal vs
  company AWS, or scrubbed/synthetic seed).
- Phase 6 backlog (hybrid RRF retrieval, structured provenance) — see `docs/roadmap.md`.
